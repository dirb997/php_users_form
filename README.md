# Next steps:
・Dockerize the project (Not exactly a requisite so if the setup fails, this step will be cancelled)

# Warning:
* When using the "Built in web-server" on PHPStorm, the delete logic does not work properly sometimes, so I recommend 
  setting the environment by yourself (Will be working in solving this error soon).
* There are some cases (or email addresses) in which the email message is not being sent or is directly sent to the spam folder.
