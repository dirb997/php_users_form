# Form used to submit information and display the registered users on the screen
Used basic php syntax, bootstrap, javascript and simple css styling.

# Completed:
1. Add input validation. ☑️
2. Create a database for the registered users. ☑️
3. Add age, password and mail validation (age requirements, mail format,...). ☑️
4. Add a flag (or an alert) to show if the form has been correctly submitted or if the submission failed. ☑️
5. Style the form.☑️
6. Add blocked users table in the database.☑️
7. Add a Login page and a Dashboard page.☑️
8. Add the validation to check if the user email and password do exist in the database.☑️ 
9. Create a redirection functionality to a specialized dashboard page based on the id user id. ☑️
10. Create a logout functionality so when we click the logout button, we are redirected to the login page. ☑️
11. In the dashboard add the edit account information functionality.☑️
    * We only can edit the following information: Name, Address, Password and Mail. 
12. In the dashboard add the delete account's information functionality (check the logic).☑️
13. Add Router file.☑️
14. Add Controllers.☑️
15. Add View templates.☑️

# Next steps:
1. Dockerize the application.

# Warning:
* When using the "Built in web-server" on PHPstorm, the delete logic does not work properly sometimes, so I recommend 
  setting the environment by yourself (Will be working in solving this error soon).
